## Introduction
Multisensory perception involves integrating information from different sensory modalities (e.g., visual and auditory). This project implements three models for estimating the true stimulus rate based on sensory inputs: segregated, fused, and causal inference estimates.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ak47na/causal_inference.git
cd causal_inference
```

## Models

### Segregated Estimate
In the segregation case, the sensory inputs are processed independently. The segregated estimate for each modality is given by:
\[
\hat{s_v} = \frac{r_v \sigma_p^2 + \mu_p \sigma_v^2}{\sigma_v^2 + \sigma_p^2}
\]
\[
\hat{s_a} = \frac{r_a \sigma_p^2 + \mu_p \sigma_a^2}{\sigma_a^2 + \sigma_p^2}
\]

### Fused Estimate
In the fusion case, the sensory inputs are combined based on their relative reliabilities. The fused estimate is:
\[
\hat{s} = \frac{r_v \sigma_a^2 \sigma_p^2 + r_a \sigma_v^2 \sigma_p^2 + \mu_p \sigma_v^2 \sigma_a^2}{\sigma_v^2 \sigma_a^2 + \sigma_v^2 \sigma_p^2 + \sigma_a^2 \sigma_p^2}
\]

### Causal Inference Estimate
The causal inference model incorporates the belief about whether the sensory inputs come from a common source or separate sources. The estimate is:
\[
\hat{s} = p(c = 1 | r_v, r_a) \hat{s}_{\text{fusion}} + p(c = 2 | r_v, r_a) \hat{s}_{\text{segregation}}
\]
Where the posterior probability of the common cause hypothesis is:
\[
p(c = 1 | r_v, r_a) = \frac{p(r_v, r_a | c = 1) \pi_c}{p(r_v, r_a | c = 1) \pi_c + p(r_v, r_a | c = 2) (1 - \pi_c)}
\]
